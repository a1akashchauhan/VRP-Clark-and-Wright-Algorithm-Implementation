# VRP-Clark-and-Wright-Algorithm-Implementation
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is an optimization problem where a set 
of vehicles are required to serve a given set of customers with a 
minimum cost. In VRP, vehicles have a limited capacity and each 
customer has a specific demand that must be satisfied. The objective is 
to minimize the total distance travelled by all the vehicles. VRP is an NPhard problem and there are many algorithms developed to solve it. One 
of the most popular algorithms is the Clark and Wright Savings 
Algorithm, which is a constructive heuristic that generates an initial 
feasible solution for VRP. 
In this project, we have implemented the Clark and Wright 
Savings Algorithm to solve a VRP.
